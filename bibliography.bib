Also two precise representations of the controlled stochastic process are considered. In one representation we include the correction term [6] for the state and control-dependent noise and in the other we do not. For the case with no correction terms, the optimal control is shown to be a linear feedback of the system state variables. Uniqueness and stability conditions are presented for this problem. The case with correction term is much harder to solve and we only determine the linear optimal control. An example is included which illustrates many results of the paper.}",

abstract="This paper addresses the optimal control problem known as the linear quadratic regulator in the case when the dynamics are unknown. We propose a multistage procedure, called Coarse-ID control, that estimates a model from a few experimental trials, estimates the error in that model with respect to the truth, and then designs a controller using both the model and uncertainty estimate. Our technique uses contemporary tools from random matrix theory to bound the error in the estimation procedure. We also employ a recently developed approach to control synthesis called System Level Synthesis that enables robust control design by solving a quasi-convex optimization problem. We provide end-to-end bounds on the relative error in control cost that are optimal in the number of parameters and that highlight salient properties of the system to be controlled such as closed-loop sensitivity and optimal control magnitude. We show experimentally that the Coarse-ID approach enables efficient computation of a stabilizing controller in regimes where simple control schemes that do not take the model uncertainty into account fail to stabilize the true system.",

  abstract = 	 {The effectiveness of model-based versus model-free methods is a long-standing question in reinforcement learning (RL).  Motivated by recent empirical success of RL on continuous control tasks, we study the sample complexity of popular model-based and model-free algorithms on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR).  We show that for policy evaluation, a simple model-based plugin method requires asymptotically less samples than the classical least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) estimator to reach the same quality of solution; the sample complexity gap between the two methods can be at least a factor of state dimension.  For policy optimization, we study a simple family of problem instances and show that nominal (certainty equivalence principle) control also requires several factors of state and input dimension fewer samples than the policy gradient method to reach the same level of control performance on these instances.  Furthermore, the gap persists even when employing baselines commonly used in practice.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result which demonstrates a separation in the sample complexity between model-based and model-free methods on a continuous control task.}
